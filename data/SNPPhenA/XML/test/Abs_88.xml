<abstract ABSTRACTID="1087" TEXT="Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common multifactorial disorder that involves abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. Genome-wide association studies have identified a major risk locus for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction on chromosome 9p21. Here, we examined the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 9p21 in a sample of Turkish patients with MetS and further investigated the correlation between regional SNPs, haplotypes, and MetS. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze 4 SNPs (rs10757274 A/G, rs2383207 A/G, rs10757278 A/G, rs1333049 C/G) in 291 MetS patients and 247 controls. Analysis of 4 SNPs revealed a significant difference in the genotype distribution for rs2383207, rs10757278, and rs1333049 between MetS patients and controls (p = 0.041, p = 0.005, p = 0.023, respectively) but not for rs10757274 (p = 0.211). MetS and control allelic frequencies for rs2383207, rs10757278, and rs1333049 were statistically different (p &lt; 0.05). The rs2383207 AG variant, was identified as a MetS risk factor (p = 0.012, OR = 33.271; 95 % CI: 2.193-504.805) and the AA haplotype in block 1 and the GC, AG haplotypes in block 2 were associated with MetS (χ (2) = 3.875, p = 0.049; χ (2) = 9.334, p = 0.0022; χ (2) = 9.134, p = 0.0025, respectively). In this study, we found that chromosome 9p21 SNP rs10757278 and related haplotypes correlate with MetS risk. This is the first report showing an association between a 9p21 variant and MetS and suggests that rs10757278 polymorphism may confer increased risk for disease.">
