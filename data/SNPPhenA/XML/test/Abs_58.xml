<abstract ABSTRACTID="1054" TEXT="OBJECTIVE:  This study aimed to test the association between the Val158Met polymorphism rs4680 of the catechol-O-methyl transferase gene andanorexia nervosa (AN). METHODS: First, an association study on two cohorts (306 cases and 1009 controls from Utrecht, and 174 cases and 466 controls from Leiden/NTR) was performed. Subsequently, the results were integrated into a meta-analysis, together with all the case-control and family-based studies, which were testing the same hypothesis and were available in the literature. Altogether, eight studies (11 datasets) were included in this meta-analysis, with a total of 2021 cases, 2848 controls, and 89 informative (heterozygous) trios. RESULTS: The present association studies found no association between AN and rs4680 when testing the allelic contrast [Utrecht odds ratio (OR)=1.14, P=0.14; Leiden OR=1.02, P=0.85]. There was an indication of an association under the dominant model of genetic effect in the Utrecht cohort (for the Met allele, OR=1.42, P=0.03). Nevertheless, the meta-analyses of both the allelic contrast and the dominant effect were nonsignificant (the allelic pooled OR=1.03, P=0.42 and the dominant pooled OR=1.1, P=0.18). The meta-analyses were performed under the fixed-effect model and there was no significant heterogeneity among the effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analytically combined evidence from the present genotypings and the literature search shows that the effect sizes are homogeneous across studies and that rs4680 is not associated with AN.">
