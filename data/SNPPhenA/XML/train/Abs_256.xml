<abstract ABSTRACTID="1175" TEXT="One thousand thirty-eight normal glucose-tolerant and 1031 type 2 diabetic subjects selected from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay to investigate the association of rs12255372(G/T) and rs7903146(C/T) polymorphisms of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Asian Indians. The frequency of the &quot;T&quot; allele of both rs12255372(G/T) and rs7903146(C/T) polymorphisms was significantly higher in diabetic subjects (23% and 33%) compared to that in normal glucose-tolerant subjects (19% and 28%; P = .001 and P = .0001, respectively). Logistic regression analysis of the rs12255372(G/T) polymorphism showed that the odds ratio (adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index) was 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.37; P = .034) for the TT genotype and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.06-1.58; P = .011) for the TG genotype when compared with the GG genotype. Adjusted odds ratios for the TT and TC genotypes of the rs7903146(C/T) polymorphism were found to be 1.50 (95% CI, 1.08-2.08; P = .013) and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.18-1.76; P = .0003), respectively, compared with the CC genotype.P? Normal glucose-tolerant subjects with the TT genotype of rs12255372(G/T) had significantly higher  2-hour plasma glucose levels (mean +/- SD, 6.1 +/- 1.4 mmol/L) than those with the GG genotype (5.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/L, P = .011). Normal glucose-tolerant subjects with the TT genotype of rs7903146(C/T) polymorphism had significantly higher 2-hour plasma glucose levels (mean +/- SD, 6.0 +/- 1.3 mmol/L) than those with the CC genotype (5.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/L, P = .004). In conclusion, the T allele of the rs12255372(G/T) and rs7903146(C/T) polymorphisms of TCF7L2 gene confer susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in Asian Indians.">
