<abstract ABSTRACTID="1043" TEXT="A recent study found association of one microsatellite and five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in intron 3 of the TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Icelandic, Danish and American populations. The aim of the present study was to investigate if those SNPs were associated to T2D in two (family- and population-based) cohorts from northern Sweden. We genotyped four of the associated SNPs in a case-control cohort consisting of 872 T2D cases and 857 controls matched with respect to age, sex and geographical origin and in a sample of 59 extended families (148 affected and 83 unaffected individuals). Here, we report replication of association between T2D and three SNPs in the case-control (rs7901695, P=0.003; rs7901346, P=0.00002; and. rs12255372, P=0.000004) and two SNPs in the family-based  (rs7901695, P=0.01 and rs7901346, P=0.04) samples from northern Sweden. This replication strengthens the evidence for involvement of TCF7L2 in T2D.">
