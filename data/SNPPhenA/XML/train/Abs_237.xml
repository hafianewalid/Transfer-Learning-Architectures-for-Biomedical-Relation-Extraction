<abstract ABSTRACTID="1154" TEXT="TCF7L2, HHEX and IDE on chromosome 10q23-25 reside within the linkage region for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Previous studies including ours have demonstrated that genetic polymorphisms in these three loci are associated with T2D, respectively. But, it is unclear whether TCF7L2, independently or interactively with HHEX and IDE, confer the susceptibility to T2D. In the present study, we first replicated genetic association study of the TCF7L2 gene in a Swedish cohort including 528 non-diabetic healthy controls and 243 T2D patients and then evaluated combining effect from common risk polymorphisms in TCF7L2-HHEX-IDE loci. T2D patients were diagnosed in the intermediate study time. To avoid influence from anti-diabetic treatment, baseline data in all T2D patients were used for analysis. We found that SNPs rs7901695, rs4506565, rs7903146 and rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene were strongly associated with T2D (p&lt;0.004). In rs7903146, T2D patients carrying genotypes CT or TT had higher fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels (p=0.042) and lower HOMA-beta index (p=0.015) and BMI (p=0.015) compared to the patients carrying CC genotype. Furthermore, the risk alleles from TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism either with IDErs2251101 polymorphism (p=0.0257, OR=1.398) or with HHEX rs1544210 polymorphism (p=0.0024, OR=1.514) were significantly associated with T2D. When risk alleles from three loci were combined, the association with T2D remained significant (p=0.0018, OR=1.506). The present study thus provides evidence that TCF7L2, as the main gene, together with HHEX and IDE loci have combining effects on genetic predisposition to T2D.">
