RESULTS: Genome-wide significance in fully adjusted models (sex, age, APOE genotype, population stratification) was observed for a SNP in   ABCA7 (rs115550680, allele = G; frequency, 0.09 cases and 0.06 controls; odds ratio [OR], 1.79 [95% CI, 1.47-2.12]; P = 2.2 × 10(-9)), which is in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs previously associated with Alzheimer disease in Europeans (0.8 < D' < 0.9).
