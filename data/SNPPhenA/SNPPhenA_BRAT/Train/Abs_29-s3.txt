We also genotyped these SNPs in nondiabetic, non-Amish subjects (n = 48), in whom intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed, and found an association between rs7901695 and rs7903146 and insulin sensitivity (P = 0.003 and P = 0.005, respectively) and disposition index (P = 0.04 and P = 0.007, respectively).
