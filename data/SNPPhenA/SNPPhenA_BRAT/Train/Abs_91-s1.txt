We found that: (i) genotypes, including those of APOA5 S19W, APOA5 -1131T > C, APOE, GCKR, TRIB1 and TBL2/MLXIPL, were significantly associated with severe HTG; (ii) odds ratios for these genetic variables were significant in both univariate and multivariate regressionanalyses, irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes or obesity; (iii) a significant fraction-about one-quarter-of the explained variation in disease status was associated with these genotypes.
