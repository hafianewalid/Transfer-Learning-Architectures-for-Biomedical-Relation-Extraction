Two polymorphisms (rs7412, rs429358) that define the epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4 isoforms of apolipoprotein E were significantly associated with percent reduction in LDL-C with atorvastatin (epsilon2 carriers 53.8%, epsilon3/epsilon3 48.1%, and epsilon4 carriers 46.4%, respectively, P=0.00039) and replicated in the pravastatin arm (epsilon2 carriers 22.1%, epsilon3/epsilon3 21.8%, and epsilon4 carriers 16.6%, respectively, P=0.00038).
