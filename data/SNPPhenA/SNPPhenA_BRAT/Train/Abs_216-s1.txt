The results showed that four SNPs in AURKA (data in recessive model, rs2273535: OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.03-4.66, p = 0.0422; rs2298016: OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.18-0.82, p = 0.0141; rs6024836: OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.18-2.00, p = 0.0014; rs10485805: OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.47-0.98, p = 0.0380) and one SNP in BRCA1(rs3737559, dominant model OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.11-1.64, p = 0.0030) were associated with breast cancer susceptibility.
