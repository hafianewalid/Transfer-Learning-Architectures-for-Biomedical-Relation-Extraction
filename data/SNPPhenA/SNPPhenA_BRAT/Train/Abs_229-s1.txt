Three SNPs[rs429358 in APOE: odds ratio (OR)=4.24, 95% confidence interval (CI)=3.01-5.96, P=1.23×10; rs2075650 in APOE: OR=3.57, 95% CI=2.51-5.06, P=1.23×10; and rs677909 in PICALM: OR=0.63, 95% CI=0.49-0.81, P=0.00036, log additive model] were significantly associated with AD susceptibility after correction for multiple testing.
