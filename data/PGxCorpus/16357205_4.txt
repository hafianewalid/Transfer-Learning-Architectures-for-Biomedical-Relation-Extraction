Using an embryonic stem cell line engineered with tetracycline -inducible Cdx4 , we demonstrate that ectopic Cdx4 expression promotes hematopoietic mesoderm specification , increases hematopoietic progenitor formation , and , together with HoxB4 , enhances multilineage hematopoietic engraftment of lethally irradiated adult mice .
