BACKGROUND : The aim of this study is to analyze polymorphisms in genes involved in 6-mercaptopurine detoxification ( TPMT ) ; methotrexate ( MTX ) metabolism including ABCB1 ( or MDR1 ) , ABCC2 , SLC19A1 ( or RFC1 ) , and SLCO1B1 ; and the MTX effect mainly MTHFR and TYMS , and to assess whether these polymorphisms are predictors of treatment toxicity and/or MTX clearance .
