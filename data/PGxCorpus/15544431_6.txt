Furthermore , in our recent study , it was also shown that cigarette smoke exposure induces hepatic CYP2A8 in hamsters , which is homologous to CYP2A6 in human , and hepatic S9 fraction exposed to cigarette smoke increases the mutagenicity of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone ( NNK ) , a tobacco specific nitrosamine , which is in line with the fact that NNK is metabolically activated by CYP2A6 .
