RESULTS : Tamoxifen -treated patients carrying the CYP2D6 alleles * 4 , * 5 , * 10 , * 41 -all associated with impaired formation of antiestrogenic metabolites -had significantly more recurrences of breast cancer , shorter relapse-free periods ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 2.24 ; 95 % CI , 1.16 to 4.33 ; P = .02 ) , and worse event-free survival rates ( HR , 1.89 ; 95 % CI , 1.10 to 3.25 ; P = .02 ) compared with carriers of functional alleles .
