UNASSIGNED : Although the single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs12979860 in the IL28B gene is a better predictor of sustained virological response to treatment of chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) than other baseline factors , some CHC patients with the favorable C allele can not achieve a sustained virological response when treated with peginterferon plus ribavirin .
