Our results show that genotyping A-241G may help to predict the efficacy of risperidone treatment on the basis that patients with the A allele showed greater improvement than those with the G allele on the overall BPRS ( chi2 = 7.19 , p = 0.007 , p = 0.031 after correction by the program SNPSpD ) , while other polymorphisms , including -141 C Ins/Del , TaqIB , rs1076562 , T939C and TaqIA , did not show any association with the response to risperidone .
