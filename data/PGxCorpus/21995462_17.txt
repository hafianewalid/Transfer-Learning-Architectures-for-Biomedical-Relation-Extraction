Conditional haplotype analyses revealed that the haplotypic constructs comprising the IVS4+76G>A , 699G>A ( Met233Ile ) , IVS12-5676A>G , and *347_*348insA polymorphisms were critical determinants of variability in docetaxel disposition [ clearance and area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ( 0 , ) ) : r ( 2 ) = 29 % and 22 % , respectively ] .
