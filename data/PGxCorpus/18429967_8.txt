In CYP3A5 * 1 allele carriers ( CYP3A5 expressers ) , body weight-adjusted oral clearance was markedly decreased from the early stage to the maintenance stage [ 0.622 ( 0.534 , 0.709 ) to 0.369 l h ( -1 ) kg ( -1 ) ( 0.314 , 0425 ) ] compared with a smaller decrease [ 0.368 ( 0.305 , 0.430 ) to 0.305 ( 0.217 , 0.393 ) ] in CYP3A5 non-expressers ; however , the CYP3A5 genetic variation did not influence tacrolimus chronopharmacokinetics .
