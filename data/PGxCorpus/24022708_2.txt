Considering that the genotypes of CYP2C19 and MDRI C3435T are two major factors attributed to the inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability of lansoprazole ( LSZ ) , the aim of the study was to simultaneously elucidate the effects of CYP2C19 and MDRI C3435T polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics difference of LSZ and its metabolites 5'-hydroxy lansoprazole ( HLSZ ) and lansoprazole sulphone ( LSZS ) following oral administration of LSZ tablets in healthy Chinese subjects .
