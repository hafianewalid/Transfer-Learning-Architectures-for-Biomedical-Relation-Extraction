The level of dimethyl histone H3 lysine 4 ( H3K4me2 ) in the RARa gene-promoter region , PU.1 upstream regulatory region ( URE ) and RUNX1 +24 / +25 intronic enhancer was higher in MLL - AF9 -positive cells than in MLL - AF4 -positive cells , and inhibiting lysine -specific demethylase 1 , which acts as a histone demethylase inhibitor , reactivated ATRA sensitivity in MLL - AF4 -positive cells .
