Furthermore , the haplotype-specific FBAT showed a common ( 22.5 % ) CHRNA4 haplotype , GCTATA , which was significantly associated with both a protective effect against nicotine addiction as a dichotomized trait ( Z = -3.04 , P < .005 ) and significant decreases of age-adjusted FTND ( Z = -3.31 , P < .005 ) or RTQ scores ( Z = -2.73 , P = .006 ) .
