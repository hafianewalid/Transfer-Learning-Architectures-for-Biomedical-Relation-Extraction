In a pilot clinical trial involving 10 F508del - CFTR homozygous CF patients , the combination of cysteamine and EGCG restored BECN1 , reduced SQSTM1 levels and improved CFTR function from nasal epithelial cells in vivo , correlating with a decrease of chloride concentrations in sweat , as well as with a reduction of the abundance of TNF / TNF-alpha ( tumor necrosis factor ) and CXCL8 ( chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 8 ) transcripts in nasal brushing and TNF and CXCL8 protein levels in the sputum .
