We studied the relation between renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) related gene polymorphisms , such as angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) insertion/deletion ( I/D ) , angiotensinogen ( AGT ) M253T and angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AT1R ) A1166C , and the effect of quinapril , an ACE inhibitor with high tissue-binding affinity , on preventing restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
