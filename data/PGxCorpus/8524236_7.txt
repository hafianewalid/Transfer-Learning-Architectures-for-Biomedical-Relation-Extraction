In plasmid constructs which contained a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and the wild-type ER/ Sp1 promoter sequence , E2 -induced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity and mRNA levels were inhibited by TCDD whereas no inhibition was observed with the mutant ER/ Sp1 - " XRE " plasmids .
