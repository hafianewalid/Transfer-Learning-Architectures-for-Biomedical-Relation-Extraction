RESULTS : Logistic regression analysis showed that the minor allele frequencies of TAPBP rs2071888 C>G ( Thr260Arg ) on exon 4 ( P > 0.05 ) , which was in absolute linkage disequilibrium with rs1059288 T>C on 3 ' UTR , were significantly higher in the AERD group than in the aspirin -tolerant asthma group , and the P values remained significant after multiple comparisons ( Pcorr = 0.006 , odds ratio : 1.37 , 95 % confidence interval : 1.11-1 .69 , additive model ; Pcorr = 0.009 , odds ratio : 1.52 , 95 % confidence interval : 1.14-2 .03 , dominant model ) .
