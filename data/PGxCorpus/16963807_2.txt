To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the effect of curcumin on up-regulation of LDL receptor expression , a sterol regulatory report system was established in Xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjection of a plasmid pLXRN-4SRE-fPA , in which green fluorescence protein ( GFP ) gene was constructed downstream from the sterol regulatory element-1 ( SRE-1 ) , in the nucleus of the oocytes .
