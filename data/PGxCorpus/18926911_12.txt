It was also observed that subjects whose genotype presented one synonymous substitution ( S ) in one HLA-G allele in the HLA-G 0101 group of alleles and another allele with a non-synonymous substitution ( N/S ) on HLA- G0103 , HLA- G010401 , HLA-G010403 or HLA- G0105N alleles , apparently had a greater chance of rejection episodes .
