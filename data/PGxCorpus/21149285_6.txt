Thus , we genotyped the individual HLA-A alleles in 61 cases and 376 patients who showed no cADRs by administration of CBZ ( CBZ -tolerant controls ) and found that HLA-A * 3101 was present in 60.7 % ( 37/61 ) of the patients with CBZ -induced cADRs , but in only 12.5 % ( 47/376 ) of the CBZ -tolerant controls ( odds ratio = 10.8 , 95 % confidence interval 5.9-19 .6 , P = 3.64 10 ) , implying that this allele has the 60.7 % sensitivity and 87.5 % specificity when we apply HLA-A * 3101 as a risk predictor for CBZ -induced cADRs .
