Using confocal microscopy , we demonstrate that intraperitoneal CCK administration increases the number of neurons that express phosphorylated ERK1/2 ( pERK1/2 ) in the medial and commissural subnuclei of the NTS and that CCK -induced expression of ERK1/2 is increased in tyrosine hydroxylase -immunoreactive neurons .
