We chose a 30 M concentration of 4-HNE , which produced an approximately 50 % inhibition of complex I - or complex II- driven respiration , to assess whether prior in vivo Nrf2 - ARE -activating compounds would increase the resistance of the isolated cortical mitochondria to 4-HNE 's mitotoxic effects .
