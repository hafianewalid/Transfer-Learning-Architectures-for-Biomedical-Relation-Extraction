CONCLUSION : : Gefitinib in combination with bevacizumab as first-line therapy seems to be a favorable and well-tolerated treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR gene mutations , especially those with EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations , although the primary end point was not met because the lower limit of the CI was less than 40 % .
