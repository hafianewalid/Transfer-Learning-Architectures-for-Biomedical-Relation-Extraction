We genotyped four SNPs ( rs4795893 , rs1024611 , rs4586 and rs2857657 ) distributed throughout the CCL2 gene and examined them for association using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) score in two independent cohorts of Chinese schizophrenic patients ( n = 208 ) from two different geographic areas , following an 8-week period of risperidone monotherapy .
